# Repair

Repair allows you to use an iron block to repair armor and tools.

## XP Gain

Repair tools or armor using the mcMMO Anvil. This is an iron block by default and should not be confused with the Vanilla Minecraft Anvil.

## How can I use Repair?

Place down a mcMMO Anvil and right-click to repair the item  you're currently holding. This consumes 1 item on every use.

## How does Repair Mastery work?

Repair Mastery increases the repair amount. The extra amount repaired is influenced by your Repair skill level.

## How does Super Repair work?

Super Repair is a passive ability. When repairing an item, it grants players a chance to repair an item with double effectiveness.

## How does Arcane Forging work?

This passive ability allows you to repair items with a certain chance of maintaining its enchantments. The enchants may be kept at their existing levels, downgraded to a lower level, or lost entirely.
