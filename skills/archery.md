# Archery

Archery is about shooting with your bow and arrow. It provides various combat bonuses, such as a damage boost that scales with your level and the ability to daze your opponents in PvP. In addition to this, you can retrieve some of your spent arrows from the corpses of your foes.

## XP Gain

To gain XP in this skill you need to shoot mobs or other players.

## How does Skill Shot work?

Skill Shot provides additional damage to your shots. The bonus damage from Skill Shot increases as you level in Archery. With the default settings, your archery damage increases 10% every 50 levels, to a maximum of 200% bonus damage.

## How does Daze work?

You have a passive chance to daze other players when you shoot them. When Daze triggers it forces your opponents to look straight up for a short duration. A Daze shot also deals an additional 4 damage (2 hearts).

## How does Arrow Retrieval work?

You have a passive chance to retrieve some of your arrows when you kill a mob with your bow. This chance increases as you level in Archery. By default, this ability increases by 0.1% per level, up to 100% at level 1000.
