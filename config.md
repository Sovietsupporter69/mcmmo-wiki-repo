# Configuring mcMMO

> This page is under construction, **you** can add to it and help complete it!
{.is-warning}

Default config files will be generated by default when you first install the plugin, and on every restart. To reset a config file back to its default values you can simply delete it, and McMMO will put in the default files next time you restart the plugin.

This page will summarize all config files, and you can simply click the file name to view more detailed information about it.

All config files are located in `/plugins/mcMMO`. All changes require a restart to take effect. Reloading is NOT supported!

Default config files can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/mcMMO-Dev/mcMMO/tree/master/src/main/resources).

## Configuration Files

Here is the list of all configuration files.

## Notes & Tips

mcMMO configuration files are in a format known as YAML.

YAML expects entries to have 4 spaces in front of them (not tabs).

You can check if your file is valid YAML by using this 3rd party site â†’ [YAML Lint](https://www.yamllint.com/)

Keep in mind, just because a file is valid YAML does not mean the entries in the config file are valid.

At start-up mcMMO will check the config file for any illegal values and shut down mcMMO if it finds any. Pay attention to your server log as mcMMO is quite verbose when it finds invalid keys in the configuration files.

If config files do not exist mcMMO will copy default versions from within the `mcMMO.jar`.

If you update mcMMO and we add new settings to the config file, we will add those into your existing config files for you.
